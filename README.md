# Description
Saint Mary's University has a vast, interconnected system of buildings, and it is possible to access almost every relevant academic or residence building without stepping foot in the chaotic Halifax weather. 
Slight issue, people often don't know how to navigate the buildings, and may not know all of the paths that are possible, leading to dead-ends, backtracking, and wasted time. 

# Goals
##### In roughly descending order of importance
- Add something detailing what to do in each floor to get to the next floor on the list
- Add intra-floor navigation
- Web/Mobile version
- Add distance and/or time calculations
- Add buildings unreachable indoor-only, or add outdoor pathing (like the gym and student centre)
- Visuals
